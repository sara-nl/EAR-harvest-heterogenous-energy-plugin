    -j      specifies the job id and step id to retrieve with the format [jobid.stepid].
                A user can only retrieve its own jobs unless said user is privileged. [default: all jobs]

    -t      specifies the energy_tag of the jobs that will be retrieved. [default: all tags].
    -l      shows the information for each node for each job instead of the global statistics for said job.

.SH BUGS
    - Saving the output to a file with the -c option and then reading it with -f may cause some issues if there are empty fields.

These tests are designed to evaluate the different plugin options to be supported by slurm plugin, E\+A\+RD, and E\+A\+RL
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Assuming ear=on, some results depend on user privilege
\item Test from 1..100 are designed to test srun options. They must be executes in the command line without arguments (./test1.sh) . They use kernels binaries, so they must be compiled before using the tests. It is also assumed they are executed in the same folder since executable path is relative.
\item tests test1\+X\+X.\+sh replicates test\+X\+X.\+sh but the are testing sbatch usage. They must be submitted using sbatch test\+X\+X.\+sh. Folder O\+U\+TS must be manually created before execution.

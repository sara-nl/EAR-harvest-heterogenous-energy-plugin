The E\+AR Global Manager Daemon (E\+A\+R\+G\+MD) is a cluster wide component that controls the percetage of the maximum energy consumed. It can be configured to take actions automatically like warning sysadmins to take actions or limiting the nodes policy.

\subsection*{Requirements }

E\+A\+R\+G\+MD uses periodic power metrics reported by ../daemon/\+R\+E\+A\+D\+ME.md \char`\"{}\+E\+A\+R\+D\char`\"{}, the per-\/node daemon, including job identification details (job id and step id if you are using the S\+L\+U\+RM plugin). These metrics are stored and aggregated in a Maria\+DB (My\+S\+QL) database through the ../database\+\_\+cache/\+R\+E\+A\+ME.md \char`\"{}\+E\+A\+R\+D\+B\+D\char`\"{}.

\subsection*{Configuration }

The E\+AR Global Manager Daemon uses the {\ttfamily /ear.conf} file to be configured. It can be dynamically configured by reloading the service.

Please visit the ../../etc/conf/\+R\+E\+A\+D\+ME.md \char`\"{}\+E\+A\+R configuration file page\char`\"{} for more information about the options of E\+A\+R\+G\+MD and other components.

Functional tests are programs which tests concrete library and daemon functionalities against your system hardware, kernel and libraries.

\subsection*{How to launch these tests }

You will need privileges to execute some of these tests. In case you are running sudo, be sure to append your libraries path to {\ttfamily L\+D\+\_\+\+L\+I\+B\+R\+A\+R\+Y\+\_\+\+P\+A\+TH} as the following example\+:


\begin{DoxyCode}
1 sudo LD\_LIBRARY\_PATH=<freeipmi\_lib\_path> tests/functionals/freeipmi\_overhead
\end{DoxyCode}

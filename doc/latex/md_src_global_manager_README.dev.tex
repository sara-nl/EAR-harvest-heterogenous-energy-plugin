The global manager offers a simple A\+PI {\ttfamily eargm\+\_\+api.\+c} to notify the execution and finalization of the jobs. The A\+PI just notifies the E\+A\+R\+G\+MD about the number of nodes to be used and released after the execution of the job. The S\+L\+U\+RM plugin automatically does this task.

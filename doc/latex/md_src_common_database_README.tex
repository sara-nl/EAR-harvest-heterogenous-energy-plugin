\item Compile and install E\+AR with the database option enabled.
\item Modify the /etc/ear/ear.conf file to specify the name of the database that will be created and the name of the user that E\+AR will use.
\item Run the command \$\+E\+A\+R\+\_\+\+I\+N\+S\+T\+A\+L\+L\+\_\+\+P\+A\+TH/sbin/ear\+\_\+create\+\_\+database with the IP address of the My\+S\+QL\textquotesingle{}s server location. My\+S\+QL\textquotesingle{}s root user needs permission to log from the location in which the command is being executed (if it\textquotesingle{}s being executed locally nothing needs to be done). If the root user has a password, it must be specified in the command with the \+\_\+-\/p\+\_\+ option.
\item Modify the file /etc/ear/ear.conf to specify in the database section the IP of the My\+S\+QL server as well as the user if you want to use another user. Make sure that the said user (which may or may not have been created with the ear\+\_\+create\+\_\+database command) has the proper permissions towards the database created (only I\+N\+S\+E\+RT and S\+E\+L\+E\+CT privileges are needed) as well as permission to access the database from foreign I\+Ps (such as the ones from the computation nodes).
\item Start either the E\+AR daemon, the slurm controller and daemon with the E\+AR plugin or the {\itshape eard} service.
\item Run the jobs. The data should be successfully stored when a job is completed

\section*{Database information}

The main tables in the database Report and each of their rows are\+:


\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Applications\+: Contains basic information about where the application was executed (node\+\_\+id) and the id\textquotesingle{}s of the executed job and the final computated application signature.
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Jobs\+: Contains the information about a job execution \mbox{[}user\+\_\+id, app\+\_\+id,start\+\_\+time, end\+\_\+time\mbox{]}, as well as the E\+AR parameters defined executon (policy, threshold) and node information (procs, def\+\_\+f).
\item Signatures\+: Contains the information of an application signature computed and used by E\+AR.
\item Loops\+: Contains the information of an application loop, its identifying characteristics (type of event, size, level and total iterations), the job it belongs to and the computed signature of the loop.
\item Power\+\_\+signatures\+: Contains power metrics of an application.
\item Periodic\+\_\+metrics\+: Contains information about a node\textquotesingle{}s energy consumption with the purpose of monitoring it.
\item Periodic\+\_\+aggregations\+: Contains the same information as Periodic\+\_\+metrics but aggregated by periods of time, not of each node individually.
\item Learning\+\_\+\mbox{[}tables\mbox{]}\+: The tables that begin with the \char`\"{}\+Learning\+\_\+\char`\"{} prefix contain the same as their counterparts without prefix, but are used exclusively for the learning phase of the E\+AR library.
\end{DoxyItemize}
\end{DoxyItemize}

-\/\+The relationship between the tables can be seen in the adjunct diagram, as well as the general equivalent of their My\+S\+QL types.

Other tables are\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Events\+: Contains a registry of E\+AR events (change in frequency, Dyn\+A\+IS on/off, etc.).
\item Warnings\+: Contains a registry of E\+AR\textquotesingle{}s Global Manager warnings.

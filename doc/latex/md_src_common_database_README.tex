\item Compile and install E\+AR with the database option enabled.
\item Modify the \$\+E\+T\+C\+\_\+\+E\+AR/ear/ear.conf file to specify in the database section the IP of the My\+S\+QL server as well as the user, user password (optional) and database port. Make sure that the said user (which may or may not have been created with the ear\+\_\+create\+\_\+database command) has the proper permissions towards the database created (only I\+N\+S\+E\+RT and S\+E\+L\+E\+CT privileges are needed) as well as permission to access the database from foreign I\+Ps (such as the ones from the computation nodes). Said privileges should be granted at database creation, but some My\+S\+QL configurations may interfere and privileges will have to be granted manually by the admin.
\item Run the command \$\+E\+A\+R\+\_\+\+I\+N\+S\+T\+A\+L\+L\+\_\+\+P\+A\+TH/sbin/ear\+\_\+create\+\_\+database, which will create the database and user with the configuration previously specified in the ear.\+conf file. My\+S\+QL\textquotesingle{}s root user needs permission to log from the location in which the command is being executed (if it\textquotesingle{}s being executed locally nothing needs to be done). If the root user has a password, use the \+\_\+-\/p\+\_\+ option which will ask the user to introduce it.
\item Start either the E\+AR daemon, the slurm controller and daemon with the E\+AR plugin or the {\itshape eard} service.
\item Run the jobs. The data should be successfully stored when a job is completed.

\section*{Database information}

The main tables in the database Report and each of their rows are\+: \begin{DoxyVerb}- Applications:  Contains basic information about where the application was executed (node_id) and the id's of the executed job and the final computated application signature.

- Jobs:  Contains the information about a job execution [user_id, app_id,start_time, end_time], as well as the EAR parameters defined executon (policy, threshold) and node information (procs, def_f). 

- Signatures: Contains the information of an application signature computed and used by EAR.

- Loops: Contains the information of an application loop, its identifying characteristics (type of event, size, level and total iterations), the job it belongs to and the computed signature of
the loop.

- Power_signatures: Contains power metrics of an application.

- Periodic_metrics: Contains information about a node's energy consumption with the purpose of monitoring it.

- Periodic_aggregations: Contains the same information as Periodic_metrics but aggregated by periods of time, not of each node individually.

- Learning_[tables]: The tables that begin with the "Learning_" prefix contain the same as their counterparts without prefix, but are used exclusively for the learning phase of the EAR library.
\end{DoxyVerb}


-\/\+The relationship between the tables can be seen in the adjunct diagram, as well as the general equivalent of their My\+S\+QL types.

Other tables are\+:
\begin{DoxyItemize}
\item Events\+: Contains a registry of E\+AR events (change in frequency, Dyn\+A\+IS on/off, etc.).
\item Warnings\+: Contains a registry of E\+AR\textquotesingle{}s Global Manager warnings.

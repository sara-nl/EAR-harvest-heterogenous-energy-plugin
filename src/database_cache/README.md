EAR Database Daemon
-------------------
The EAR Database Daemon (EARDBD) caches the records generated by the [EARL](../library/README.md) and [EARD](../daemon/README.md) in the system and reports it to the centralized database. It is recommended to run several EAR database daemons if the cluster is big enough, to reduce the number of inserts and connections to the database.

Also, EARDBD accumulates data during a period of time to decrease the total inserted data in the database, helping the performance of big querys. By now just the energy metrics are available to accumulate in the new metric called energy aggregation.

Requirements
------------
EARDBD uses periodic power metrics sended by [EARD](../daemon/README.md), the per-node daemon, including job identification details (job id, step id when executed in a SLURM system).

Configuration
--------------------------
The EAR Database Daemon uses the `$(ETC)/ear.conf` file to be configured. It can be dynamically configured by reloading the service.

Please visit the [EAR configuration file page](../../etc/conf/README.md) for more information about the options of EARDBD and other components.

Execution
---------
To execute this component, this `systemctl` command examples are provided:
- `sudo systemctl start eardbd` to start the EARDBD service.
- `sudo systemctl stop eardbd` to stop the EARDBD service.
- `sudo systemctl reload eardbd` to force to reload the configuration of the EARDBD service.

/*
 * Usage:
 * Just call dynais() passing the sample and the size of
 * this sample. It will be returned one of these states:
 *      END_LOOP
 *      NO_LOOP
 *      IN_LOOP
 *      NEW_ITERATION
 *      NEW_LOOP
 *      END_NEW_LOOP
 *
 * Errors:
 * A returned dynais_init() value different than 0,
 * means that something went wrong while allocating
 * memory.
 *
 * You HAVE to call dynais_init() method before with
 * the window length and the number of levels and
 * dynais_dispose() at the end of the execution.
 *
 * You can also set the METRICS define to 1 in case you
 * want some metrics at the end of the execution. Moreover,
 * you can increase MAX_LEVELS in case you need more or
 * METRICS_WINDOW, used to store the information of the
 * different loops found (sorted by size) because could
 * be necessary if you want to test big single level
 * windows.

# Energy Aware Runtime
Description
-----------
Energy Aware Runtime (EAR) is a framework to provide an energy efficient solution targeted (but not limited to) MPI applications. It aims at finding the optimal frequency for a job according to its selected energy policy, being totally dynamic and transparent.

EAR is composed by four main components: EAR library, EAR (node) Daemon, EAR Global Manager, and EAR DataBase.

EAR library. [EARL](./library/README.md) and EAR Daemon [EARD](./daemon/README.md) together are the core of the EAR framework. They provide the power policies used by mpi applications to automatically select the "best" frequency (given the policy and policy settings). In actual HPC systems, they can be configured to run the MIN_TIME_TO_SOLUTION policy, starting applications at a lower frequency than nominla but boosting "efficient" applications up to the nominal frequency (or even turbo frequency if specified by sysadmins).

EAR Global Manager.[EARGM](./global_manager/README.md) is a step beyond than only a single library. All the HPC clusters must control the energy consumed and, moreover, some others have limitations beacuse of the infrastructure (or will have limitations). The EAR Global Manager can be used in **passive** mode or **active** mode.

When configured in passive mode, the EARGM will monitor the energy consumed in the system reporting warnings to the EAR DB or simple actions (such as sending mails). When configured in active mode, the EARGM will automatically react to energy warnings detected. The current EARGM only supports predefined levels and actions in automatic mode but we are working in a new version where different levels and actions will be configured through the ear.conf file (or a similar approach) 

EAR Database. [EARDB](./database_cache/README.md) includes a MySQL data base and a several EAR Datatabase daemon (EARDBD) in charge of collect records generated by EARL and EARD in the system and report it to the centralized DB. Several EARDBD will run in the system reducing the number of connections and messages to the EAR DB and providing aggregated metrics for some of the records.
